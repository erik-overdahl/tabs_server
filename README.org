#+title: Externalize Firefox Operations

A web extension and Go project for exposing aspects of the Firefox
webextension API to external processes via the Native Messaging API.

Currently exposes most of the methods of the Tabs API and registers
listeners for most of its events.

* Design
A gateway server is started by the browser extension. It accepts
client connections on a unix socket.

In an effort to make improve the latency of client read queries,
listeners are registered on many of the Events in the browser's
extension API. These listeners push changes to the gateway server.
Changes are also pushed to all connected clients so that they have an
up-to-date picture of the state of the browser.

* To-Dos
- [ ] Better logging
- [ ] Clients can opt-in to receive pushes
- [ ] Integrate Session API
- [ ] Integrate History API
